# CISC3140_Lab5

Frontend for car data.

## Description

The objective of this lab is to build a front-end that complements the back-end that you created in Lab 4. The lab will use a combination of HTML/CSS/JS users to view data that is stored in a database as well as update data.

## Storyboard

  * View all cars list: Click on 'Cars List' -> view all car detail information on page
  * View all owners list: Click on 'Owners List' -> view all owners detail information on page
  * Search for car and owner detail information: Click on 'Search' -> input car id -> view the car information and owner information for this car id
  * Add a new car: Click on ‘Add Car’ -> Fill in form, click submit -> View confirmation page show 'Insert Successful'
  * Add a new owner: Click on ‘Add Owner’ -> Fill in form, click submit -> View confirmation page show 'Insert Successful'
  * Update a car: Click on ‘Update Car’ -> Fill in form, click submit -> View confirmation page show 'Update Successful'
  * Update a owner: Click on ‘Update Owner’ -> Fill in form, click submit -> View confirmation page show 'Update Successful'

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
